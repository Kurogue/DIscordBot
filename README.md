# Discord Bot (John Quoter)

#### V1.1
Hello everyone, this is my first discord bot that quotes professors from the past. Currently the bot will respond to messages that have the words `quote`, or any of the professors to give a specific professors quote, such as `Theado`, `Beasley`, `Yalcin`, `Karam`, or `Rubel`. The bot is in python and the method I used to make it follows [this tutorail here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok). I hope everyone can use this bot and have fun with it.

This bot is not meant to bring harm or sully a name of a professor, this  is all in good fun for the students. Please do not use the bot to sully or harm a professor's reputation.

Thanks for reading and have fun.
