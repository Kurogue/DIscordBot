# Discord Bot (John Quoter)

#### V1.1
Hello everyone, this is my first discord bot that quotes professors from the past. Currently the bot will respond to messages that have the words `quote`, or any of the professors to give a specific professors quote, such as `Theado`, `Beasley`, `Yalcin`, `Karam`, or `Rubel`. The bot is in python and the method I used to make it follows [this tutorail here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok). I hope everyone can use this bot and have fun with it.

This bot is not meant to bring harm or sully a name of a professor, this  is all in good fun for the students. Please do not use the bot to sully or harm a professor's reputation.

Thanks for reading and have fun.

#### V1.2
Added the feature where you cannot abuse sending a message with multiple flags. Lets say that you send a message of multiple professors it would send multiple messages from the database of each professor listed. That has been fixed and limited to one professor chosed at random. It does not yet have the feature to choose a random professor that was stated in the message, this is being worked on.

#### V1.3
Added slash commands to remove the unecessary spam of the bot when not wanted.
